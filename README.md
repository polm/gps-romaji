# GPS Catalog Romaji Script

This repo contains a script to add romaji to titles in the [GPS Catalog][] that don't already have them using [cutlet][]. It takes the CSV dump provided on the website as input and fills in the romaji column when empty. Entries are prefixed (by default with a ðŸ¤–) to indicate they were automatic rather than manual.
